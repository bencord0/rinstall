# While the kernel and modules contained in stage4-rpi.tar.gz
# were created using the scripts available here, any kernel/modules
# created using ./mkkernel.sh will not be placed in the image
# created using ./mkimage.sh

# This script attempts to rectify that by updating the stage4
# with any kernel.img and modules (directory) here.

echo "This script is currently unimplemented"
# 'tar --update' seems like a good way to implement this
